# 🦴 Fossil Detector

Ever wondered if you're officially a fossil?  
This fun little Python script will let you know! 😄

It asks for your name and age — then gives you a message based on your age:
- If you're 100 or older: you're a fossil now! 🦖
- If you're younger: it tells you how many years are left till you become one 😂

- 🧍 Getting input from users (input())
- 🔢 Converting data types (int())
- 🔀 Using conditions (if, else)
- 💬 Printing friendly messages

## 🤓 Why it's here

This is part of my Python learning journey.  
It's small, funny, and just the beginning — more projects coming soon!

Made with Python. And coffee. And a little sarcasm ☕😂
